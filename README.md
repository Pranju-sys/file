# file
task1:- in this program I have used 3 blocks try, except, and finally. first a file was tried to be opened in read mode in try block . if it exists, it would be appended with the stuff writen in finally block using f.write() method. if it didnt exists it would give a message of file not found in the except block and then would go to finally block to open and write to a file. the finally block , irrespective of the exception found or not performs the function of opening and writing to a file. readline function was used to reas the file line by line.
task2:- a string is inputted from the user and is wrote to a file by opening a file in write mode and using write() method. it is then closed and opened again in append mode to add new lines ,without deleting the old ones.again, it is closed and opened i read mode to read the contents of the file. using read() method.
